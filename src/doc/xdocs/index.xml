			<em>JUEL</em> is an implementation of the Unified Expression Language (EL), specified as
			part of the JSP 2.1 standard (<a href="ext:jcp.com.jsr245">JSR-245</a>).
		</p>
		<section>
			<title>Motivation</title>
			<p>
				Once, the EL started as part of JSTL. Then, the EL made its way into the JSP 2.0 standard.
				Now, though part of JSP 2.1, the EL API has been separated into package <code>javax.el</code>
				and all dependencies to the core JSP classes have been removed.
			</p>
			<p>
				In other words: the EL is ready for use in non-JSP applications!
			</p>

			<title>Features</title>
			<p>
				<em>JUEL</em> provides a lightweight and efficient implementation of the
				Unified Expression Language.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					High Performance &ndash;
					Parsing expressions is certainly the expected performance bottleneck.
					<em>JUEL</em> uses a hand-coded parser which is up to 10 times faster
					than the previously used (javacc) generated parser!
					Once built, expression trees are evaluated at highest speed.
				</li>
				<li>
					Pluggable Cache &ndash;
					Even if <em>JUEL</em>s parser is fast, parsing expressions is relative
					expensive. Therefore, it's best to parse an expression string only once.
					<em>JUEL</em> provides a default caching mechanism which should be sufficient
					in most cases. However, <em>JUEL</em> allows to plug in your own cache easily.
				</li>
				<li>
					Small Footprint &ndash;
					<em>JUEL</em> has been carefully designed to minimize memory usage as well as
					code size.
				</li>
				<li>
					Method Invocations &ndash;
					As an extension to the standard, <em>JUEL</em> can be configured to enable
					method invocations as in <code>${foo.matches('[0-9]+')}</code>.
				</li>
				<li>
					VarArg Calls &ndash;
					As another extension to the standard, <em>JUEL</em> can be configured to support
					Java 5 VarArgs. E.g., binding <code>String.format(String, String...)</code>
					to function <code>format</code> allows for <code>${format('Hey %s','Joe')}</code>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Pluggable EL&ndash;
					The <em>JUEL</em> jar has been setup to be transparently detected as EL
					implementation by a Java runtime environment or JEE5 application server.
					Using <em>JUEL</em> does not require an application to explicitly
					reference any of the <em>JUEL</em> specific implementation classes.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Status</title>
			<p>
				<em>JUEL</em> is considered production stable. The code is well tested and feature complete.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Availability</title>
			<p>
				<em>JUEL</em> is licensed under the <a href="ext:apache.org.license">Apache License 2.0</a>.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Requirements</title>
			<p>
				<em>JUEL</em>'s EL implementation (packaged into <code>juel-impl-2.1.x.jar</code>)
				depends on the <code>javax.el.*</code> API. An <code>el-api-1.x.jar</code> (taken
				from <a href="ext:uel.dev.java.net">GlassFish</a>) is included in the distribution.
